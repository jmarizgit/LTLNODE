#Learn To Love NODE

NodeJS is a system that wraps the amazing Google V8 JavaScript library. Node was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and rapidly became a success among web developers like me.

##Executing node

To execute node on your terminal run the following command:

    $ node

##Hello world! Writing your first program in node

Node runs **JavaScript**, so if you have previous experience with the language you will feel like home using it. Create a file called **hello.js** and paste the following code on it:

```javascript
console.log('Hello World!');
```

Simple right? But we are not done yet. Node provide a great number of functions for us to write really impressive applications.
