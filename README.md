#Learn To Love NODE

NodeJS is a system that wraps the amazing Google V8 JavaScript library. Node was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and rapidly became a success among web developers like me.

##Executing node

To execute node on your terminal run the following command:

    $ node

You can now write commands or mathematical operations such as follows:

```javascript
> 2 + 2
'4'
```
Simple don't you think?

##Hello world! Writing your first program in node

Node runs **JavaScript**, so if you have previous experience with the language you will feel like in home using it. Create a file called **hello.js** and paste the following code on it:

```javascript
console.log('Hello World!');
```

Now run your code:

    $ node hello.js


Simple right? But we are not done yet. Node provide a great number of functions for us to write really impressive applications. I will try to go over them on my example files.
